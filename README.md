# Phase Noise Analyzer (R&S) Screenshot OCR Tool

This tool provides an efficient solution for extracting phase noise data from screenshots captured from Rohde & Schwarz phase noise analyzers. Designed with a user-friendly GUI, it enables batch OCR processing and automatic generation of well-structured Excel reports.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily drag your screenshot folder into the GUI or manually select it — no command line required.
- **Batch OCR**: Automatically processes multiple screenshots at once, saving time and effort.
- **Excel Report Generation**: Outputs clean tabular data in `.xlsx` format for further analysis or documentation.
- **R&S Layout Optimization**: Specifically tuned to handle fonts, colors, and layouts commonly used in Rohde & Schwarz PNA screenshots.

## Why Use This Tool?

Manual transcription of measurement results is time-consuming and prone to errors. This tool is designed to streamline your Analog/RF testing workflow by:

- Automating the data extraction process
- Ensuring accuracy and consistency
- Significantly reducing manual effort

## Usage

1. Launch the GUI by running the main script.
2. Drag and drop your folder of R&S screenshots into the window, or select it via the file dialog.
3. The tool will automatically recognize and process each screenshot.
4. The results will be saved in an Excel file in the same directory.

## Target Users

- Analog/RF IC designers
- Laboratory and measurement engineers
- Researchers working with phase noise characterization
